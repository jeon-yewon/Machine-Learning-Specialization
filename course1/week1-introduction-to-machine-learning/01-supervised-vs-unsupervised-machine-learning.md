# Supervised Learning
## what is supervised learning?
- Learns from being given "right answers"
- right answers : the correct label $y$ for a given input $x$

## Types of supervised learning
### Regression
- where the task is to predict number
- infinitely many possible outputs

### Classification
- trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories

# Unsupervised Learning
## what is unsupervised learning?
- data only comes with inputs $x$, but not output labels $y$
- find something interesting in unlabeled data

## Types of unsupervised learning
### Clustering
- grouping similar data points together

### Anomaly detection
- finding unusual data points

### Dimensionality reduction
- compress data using fewer numbers while losing as little information as possible
